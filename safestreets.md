# Safe Streets New Haven

[Safe Streets New Haven](https://www.safestreetsnewhaven.org/) advocates for a safer, fairer, and more sustainable New Haven.

The Safe Streets Coalition is a diverse, citywide group of pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders, and drivers who advocate for just, safe, accessible and sustainable transportation in New Haven, focusing on underserved communities first.

Safe Streets members include advocacy veterans, policy experts, New Haven newcomers, students, and community members born and raised in this City. We are always looking to better represent our City, so please consider [being a part of our team!](https://www.safestreetsnewhaven.org/meetings)
