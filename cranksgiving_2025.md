# Cranksgiving 2025

Cranksgiving is a food drive for charity on two wheels. Part bike ride, part scavenger hunt. All you need is a bicycle, a lock and a bag!

Cranksgiving New Haven will be taking place on Sunday, November 23.

Please plan to arrive at **11 AM**.

The group will **leave from the New Haven Green (flagpole) at 11:15 AM** and people should try to **be back at DESK by 1 PM**.

Route is TBD.

Please join the [Signal group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIKYjbrY4Q5FfuQNZTDJzXlAFjsC0PNxeyzCZ6i70SMN4EhC8KlrR5ipepOG15loXPxLY) so you can get push notifications about the event, any important information will also be published to the website.

Joining the signal group will also give us a good idea for the turnout and it will help us out a lot with organizing.

This event is FREE, but you'll need $30-$40 to purchase food. Donations will support Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen.

Bike out to nearby grocery stores to pick up non-perishables that will support DESK [<https://www.deskct.org/>](https://www.deskct.org).
