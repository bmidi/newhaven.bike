## What is this?

Cranksgiving is a food drive on two wheels. Part bike ride, part madcap scavenger hunt. All you need is a bicycle, a lock and a bag!

This event is FREE, but you'll need $15-$20 to purchase food. Donations will support Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen.

Bike out to Edge of the Woods and Stop and Shop to pick up non-perishables that will support DESK <https://www.deskct.org/>

Cranksgiving is a national event that occurs in over 100 cities across the United States and Canada. Visit <www.cranksgiving.org> for more locations.
